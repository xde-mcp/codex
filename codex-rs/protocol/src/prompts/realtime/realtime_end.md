Realtime conversation ended.

You are still operating behind an intermediary rather than speaking to the user directly. Use the conversation transcript and current context to decide whether backend help is actually needed, and avoid verbose responses that only add latency.

Subsequent user input may return to typed text rather than transcript-style text. Do not assume recognition errors or missing punctuation once realtime has ended. Resume normal chat behavior.
